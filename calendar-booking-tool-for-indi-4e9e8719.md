## Product Idea

Calendar booking tool for indie co-working spaces that allows members to reserve desks, meeting rooms, and event spaces with flexible pricing and community features

## Discovery Process

The following questions were asked to better understand the requirements:

### Round 1

**Q1: What is the primary type of co-working space you're targeting?**
> Small independent spaces (1-50 desks)

**Q2: Which pricing model would best suit your target users?**
> Hybrid model combining memberships and pay-per-use

**Q3: What is the most important community feature for your platform?**
> Event organization and attendance

**Q4: How should the booking system handle recurring reservations?**
> Weekly/monthly recurring options with flexible modification

**Q5: What type of integration is most critical for your platform?**
> Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)

### Round 2

**Q1: Which user onboarding flow would provide the most value for small independent spaces?**
> Guided setup wizard with space layout customization

**Q2: What key differentiator would most appeal to independent space owners compared to enterprise solutions?**
> Customizable branding and white-label options

**Q3: Which member-focused feature would drive the most engagement in small co-working communities?**
> Member directory with skill sharing capabilities

**Q4: What booking interface would best serve both regular members and occasional users?**
> Interactive floor plan with real-time availability

### Round 3

**Q1: Given the interactive floor plan and real-time availability requirements, which architecture pattern would be most appropriate for handling live updates?**
> WebSocket-based pub/sub with Redis backend

**Q2: What technical approach would best support the white-label customization while maintaining scalable deployment?**
> Multi-tenant architecture with dynamic CSS injection

**Q3: Considering the payment integration and recurring booking requirements, which data persistence strategy would be most efficient?**
> Traditional RDBMS with materialized views

**Q4: For the member directory and skill sharing feature, which API architecture would provide the best balance of performance and flexibility?**
> Pure GraphQL with dataloaders and caching

```

## 7. API Design and Integrations

### GraphQL Schema Excerpt
```graphql
type Space {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    resources: [Resource!]!
    availability: AvailabilityMap!
    members: [Member!]!
}

type Booking {
    id: ID!
    resource: Resource!
